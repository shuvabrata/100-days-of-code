# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Nov 4, 2011

**Today's Progress**: Decided to join the challenge. Programming environment setup. Getting tool. Write sample examples to validate environment.
- Installed Python
- Installed [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Installed [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) and created an online account for hosting graph plots.
- Cloned the [100daysofcode git repo] (https://github.com/shuvabrata/100-days-of-code)
- Wrote my first sample graph program and it worked like a charm. 
- I dont know Python. So going through [Python Getting Started at PruralSight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-getting-started/)

**Thoughts:** I decided to use #100daysofcode challenge to learn something new. Grapgic plotting! This is something not in my current skill set. Also I am not famila with Python. So, why not learn python and graph plotting. A little bit of search landed me with [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/).
